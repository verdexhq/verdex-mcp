## Integration Summary: Bundled Bridge Injection with CDP Auto-Loading

### Executive Verdict

**Adoptable with minimal internal refactors, no external breaking changes.** The proposed migration to a pre-bundled bridge with event-driven CDP injection integrates cleanly with the current architecture. Public APIs and MCP tool names remain unchanged, so existing workflows and tools (including `get_ancestors`, `get_siblings`, `get_descendants`, `snapshot`, `click`, `type`, `inspect`) will continue to work as-is.

### Why It Fits

- **Public surface remains the same**: `MultiContextBrowser` continues to expose the same methods. `index.ts`’s MCP tool handlers do not need to change their signatures or behavior.
- **Bridge API is unchanged**: The injected `BridgeFactory` still produces an object with the same method names and result shapes for structural analysis and interactions.
- **More reliable injection**: Event-driven discovery (`Runtime.executionContextCreated`) and a named isolated world reduce flakiness across navigations and SPA transitions.
- **Improved debuggability**: Bundling with inline source maps enables real breakpoints and readable stack traces.

### What Changes Internally

1. Create bundle pipeline and entry:
   - `build/bundle-bridge.ts` (esbuild script)
   - `src/injected/bridge-entry.ts` (exposes `__VerdexBridgeFactory__` in the named world)
2. Add injector:
   - `src/injection/bridge-bundle.ts` (generated)
   - `src/injection/BridgeInjector.ts` (CDP event wiring + lifecycle)
3. Update `MultiContextBrowser` to use `BridgeInjector` instead of generating stringified code:
   - Replace `_setupIsolatedWorldForContext` with `bridgeInjector.setupAutoInjection(...)`
   - Replace direct `Runtime.callFunctionOn` on `bridgeObjectId` with `bridgeInjector.callBridgeMethod(...)`
4. Update types:
   - `RoleContext` gains `bridgeInjector` and drops `isolatedWorldId`/`bridgeObjectId` fields.
5. Remove old injection string path:
   - Delete `src/injected/index.ts` and any references to `injectedCode()`.

These edits are scoped and internal; external consumers and tool calls remain stable.

### Compatibility Assessment for Existing Tooling

- **MCP tool names and inputs**: Unchanged in `src/index.ts`. Calls like `get_ancestors(ref)`, `get_siblings(ref, ancestorLevel)`, `get_descendants(ref, ancestorLevel)` still delegate into `MultiContextBrowser` with the same types and response formatting.
- **Method semantics**: `BridgeFactory` continues to implement the same methods (`get_ancestors`, `get_siblings`, `get_descendants`) by delegating to `StructuralAnalyzer`. No behavioral changes are required in consumers.
- **Element ref stability**: The bridge maintains the same `elements` map and ref semantics, so previously returned refs remain meaningful within a session.
- **Role isolation**: Migrating to a named world per role (e.g., `verdex_${role}`) preserves isolation guarantees while improving predictability across navigations.

### Risks and Mitigations

- **CDP compatibility for `runImmediately`**:
  - Risk: Some Chrome versions may not support `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` with `runImmediately`.
  - Mitigation: Fallback to calling a one-time `Runtime.evaluate` of the bundle in the current document after registering it for future documents. Keep the event-driven world discovery unchanged.

- **CDP `worldName` support**:
  - Widely supported in current Chromium; ensure Puppeteer/Chromium versions are in range. If absent, use `Page.createIsolatedWorld` as a fallback pathway only for current-doc initialization (future docs continue to use `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`).

- **Multi-frame pages (iframes)**:
  - The plan keys on the top frame; if iframe support is needed later, key by `auxData.frameId` and gate method calls accordingly. This doesn’t affect current single-frame assumptions.

- **Type refactor ripple**:
  - `RoleContext` changes are internal. `src/index.ts` does not depend on the removed fields, so external behavior is unaffected.

### Net Effects on Behavior

- **More resilient across navigations**: Navigation events and context-created events gate calls, reducing transient failures.
- **Performance unchanged or improved**: Bundle once; avoid repeated string concatenation and evaluations.
- **Debugging significantly improved**: Source maps, readable code, version pinning, and health checks.

### Migration Steps (Condensed)

1. Add bundling infra and entry (`build/bundle-bridge.ts`, `src/injected/bridge-entry.ts`).
2. Generate `src/injection/bridge-bundle.ts` in a prebuild step.
3. Implement `src/injection/BridgeInjector.ts` with event-driven context tracking.
4. Update `src/types.ts` (`RoleContext`) and `src/multi-context-browser.ts` to use the injector and `callBridgeMethod`.
5. Remove `src/injected/index.ts` and old injection code paths.
6. Keep `src/index.ts` handlers as-is; no changes needed for external tools.

### Validation Checklist

- Bridge factory visible only in named world; inaccessible from main world.
- Injector observes `Runtime.executionContextCreated` for the configured `worldName` (top frame).
- Bundle version check (`BRIDGE_VERSION`) passes in health checks.
- All public methods keep working: `snapshot`, `click`, `type`, `inspect`, `get_ancestors`, `get_siblings`, `get_descendants`.
- Survives hard reloads and SPA transitions without manual reinjection.

### Conclusion

The migration plan integrates cleanly with the current codebase and preserves the external behavior relied upon by existing tools. After the internal refactor (bundle + injector + types update), your current workflows—including structural exploration via `get_ancestors`/`get_siblings`/`get_descendants`—will continue to function with no breaking changes. The plan also yields tangible benefits in reliability and debugging without altering your MCP contract.
