# üöÄ 60-Second Verdex Quick Start

This guide shows you the value of Verdex in under one minute using a realistic demo page **without any test infrastructure**.

No `data-testid` attributes. No special classes. Just raw HTML structure.

**This is where Verdex shines.** ‚ú®

---

## Prerequisites

- Verdex MCP server installed and running (see [README](README.md#-quick-start))
- AI coding assistant with MCP support (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
- The demo page loaded in your workspace

---

## üéØ The Core Problem

You have a page with 12 "Add to Cart" buttons. You need to click the one for "iPhone 15 Pro".

**Without Verdex**, AI generates:
```javascript
// ‚ùå Fragile positional selector
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).nth(2)
```

This breaks when:
- Product order changes
- New products are added
- Client-side hydration reorders elements

**With Verdex**, AI generates:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Stable, semantic selector
page.locator('section > div')
    .filter({ hasText: 'iPhone 15 Pro' })
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' })
```

This survives reordering, refactoring, and DOM changes.

---

## üìã The 60-Second Workflow

### Step 1: Open the Demo Page

The demo page is located at: `tests/demo-page.html`

### Step 2: Start Verdex

In your terminal:
```bash
npx @verdex/mcp@latest
```

Or if you have it configured in your MCP settings, it should auto-start.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Demo

**Copy-paste this prompt to your AI assistant:**

```
Navigate to file:///Users/johnchildseddy/Desktop/testnexus-codebase/TESTING/verdex-mcp/tests/demo-page.html
```

> üí° **Note**: Update the path above to match your actual workspace location

### Step 4: The Challenge

**Copy-paste this prompt:**

```
Help me write a Playwright selector to click the "Add to Cart" button 
for the iPhone 15 Pro product. Use Verdex tools to explore the page 
structure and generate a stable, container-scoped selector.
```

### Step 5: Watch the Magic ‚ú®

You'll see the AI:

1. **Call `browser_snapshot`** ‚Üí Gets accessibility tree with refs
2. **Call `get_ancestors(ref)`** ‚Üí Discovers container hierarchy
3. **Call `get_siblings(ref, level)`** ‚Üí Finds 12 product cards
4. **Call `get_descendants(ref, level)`** ‚Üí Extracts "iPhone 15 Pro" heading

Then generates:

```javascript
await page.locator('section > div')
    .filter({ hasText: 'iPhone 15 Pro' })
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' })
    .click();
```

---

## üéì Understanding What Happened

### The 3-Step Exploration Process

#### **Step 1: `get_ancestors` - Find Containers**

Discovers the containment hierarchy:

```
Level 1 (div): Contains product card content
Level 2 (div): Contains all 12 product cards (the grid)
Level 3 (section): Main products section
```

**Key insight**: "This button lives inside a card, inside a grid"

#### **Step 2: `get_siblings` - Understand Patterns**

At the grid level (Level 2), discovers:

```
Sibling 0: Contains "iPhone 15 Pro", "$999", "Add to Cart"
Sibling 1: Contains "MacBook Pro", "$1,999", "Add to Cart"
Sibling 2: Contains "Samsung S24", "$1,199", "Add to Cart"
... 9 more siblings
```

**Key insight**: "Multiple similar cards need content-based filtering"

#### **Step 3: `get_descendants` - Mine Unique Anchors**

Inside the target card, finds:

```
- h3: "iPhone 15 Pro" (unique identifier!)
- span: "$999"
- button: "Add to Cart"
```

**Key insight**: "Use the heading text to identify this specific card"

### The Result

```javascript
page.locator('section > div')     // Scope to product card
    .filter({ hasText: 'iPhone 15 Pro' })  // Filter by unique content
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' })  // Semantic targeting
```

**This selector:**
- ‚úÖ Survives DOM reordering
- ‚úÖ Survives adding/removing products
- ‚úÖ Self-documents intent ("iPhone 15 Pro's button")
- ‚úÖ Works without any test infrastructure

---

## üéØ Try More Scenarios

### Scenario 2: Out-of-Stock Products

**Prompt:**
```
Write a selector to find the first product that is NOT out of stock 
and click its "Add to Cart" button.
```

**Challenge**: The Logitech keyboard is out of stock. How does the AI filter it out?

### Scenario 3: Comparison Table

**Prompt:**
```
Write a selector to click the "Select" button for the Samsung S24 Ultra 
in the phone comparison table.
```

**Challenge**: Multiple tables, multiple buttons. How does the AI scope correctly?

### Scenario 4: Order History

**Prompt:**
```
Write a selector to click "Track Order" for order #ORD-2024-1198
```

**Challenge**: Multiple orders with similar structure. Content-based filtering required.

### Scenario 5: Shopping Cart

**Prompt:**
```
Write a selector to increase the quantity of AirPods Pro in the 
shopping cart drawer.
```

**Challenge**: Cart drawer is a fixed overlay with multiple quantity controls.

## üìä Before & After Comparison

### ‚ùå Without Verdex (Accessibility Tree Only)

**What AI sees:**
```
button "Add to Cart"
button "Add to Cart"
button "Add to Cart"
button "Add to Cart"
... (identical buttons, no structure)
```

**What AI generates:**
```javascript
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).nth(2)
```

**Problems:**
- Breaks on reordering
- Breaks on hydration changes
- Impossible to debug when it fails
- No clear intent

### ‚úÖ With Verdex (Structure + Content)

**What AI discovers:**
```
Hierarchy: button ‚Üí card ‚Üí grid ‚Üí section
Siblings: 12 similar cards at grid level
Unique anchor: "iPhone 15 Pro" heading in target card
```

**What AI generates:**
```javascript
page.locator('section > div')
    .filter({ hasText: 'iPhone 15 Pro' })
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' })
```

**Benefits:**
- Survives reordering
- Survives structural changes
- Self-documenting intent
- Container-scoped (not page-global)

## üî¨ Token Efficiency

| Approach | Tokens | Coverage | Accuracy |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Full DOM dump | 50,000+ | Complete | Low (signal/noise) |
| A11y tree only | 1,000-3,000 | Limited | Medium (no structure) |
| **Verdex exploration** | **1,000-2,000** | **Surgical** | **High (context-aware)** |

**Verdict**: Verdex uses ~25-50x fewer tokens than DOM dumps while providing richer structural context than accessibility trees alone.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

### 1. **No Test Infrastructure Required**
The demo page has zero `data-testid` attributes. Verdex works with pure HTML structure.

### 2. **Progressive Enhancement**
Add test IDs later, and selectors get even better. But they work today with what you have.

### 3. **Structure > Position**
Container-scoped selectors with content filters beat positional selectors every time.

### 4. **LLM-First Design**
Tools return raw structural facts. The LLM composes them based on your specific query and context.

### 5. **Token Efficient Iteration**
Cheap tools (~1-2k tokens) enable rapid exploration and better results.

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Run the Example Tests

See the full working Playwright tests generated with Verdex:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/demo-quickstart.spec.ts
```

Check out [`tests/demo-quickstart.spec.ts`](tests/demo-quickstart.spec.ts) to see 10+ examples of stable selectors generated using Verdex exploration.

### Try It on Your Own Application

1. Point Verdex at your dev environment
2. Pick a tricky selector you've struggled with
3. Ask AI to explore the structure with Verdex tools
4. Compare the generated selector to what you would have written manually

### Add Strategic Test IDs (Optional)

After seeing how Verdex works with pure structure, try adding a few strategic `data-testid` attributes to critical containers. Watch how selectors become even more stable.

### Explore Multi-Role Testing

If your app has multiple user types (admin/user/customer), check out the [Multi-Role Configuration](README.md#multi-role-configuration) section to test complex flows with isolated browser contexts.

## ü§î Common Questions

### **Q: What if my page has data-testids?**
**A:** Even better! Verdex will find them via `get_ancestors` and generate cleaner selectors like:
```javascript
page.getByTestId('product-card')
    .filter({ hasText: 'iPhone 15 Pro' })
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' })
```

### **Q: Does this replace Playwright MCP?**
**A:** No. Verdex is complementary. Playwright MCP is a mature, cross-browser test runner. Verdex is a Chrome-only authoring assistant focused on selector generation. Use both!

### **Q: What if my DOM is really complex?**
**A:** That's exactly when Verdex shines. Complex DOMs with deep nesting are where structural exploration tools provide the most value.

### **Q: Can I use this with non-AI workflows?**
**A:** Yes, but it's optimized for LLM consumption. The raw JSON responses are designed for programmatic use, not manual inspection.
